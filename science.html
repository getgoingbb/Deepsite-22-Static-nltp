    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      Regular physical activity improves thinking skills and lowers the risk of cognitive decline.
      Learning new, coordinated skills builds brain connectivity. Exercise also supports people with Parkinson’s — improving gait, balance, and quality of life.

      <h2>Cognition</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Moderate-to-vigorous activity is linked with better cognitive performance and reduced dementia risk.</li>
        <li>Skill learning (e.g., hand–eye drills) increases brain connectivity via neuroplasticity.</li>

      <h2>Parkinson’s & Neurological Support</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Exercise upregulates neurotrophic factors and supports better motor and non-motor outcomes.</li>
