Never Leave The Playground — Full Site Bundle (v7.4)
Upload everything to the site root and overwrite existing files.

What's in this bundle
- Absolute stylesheet path `/site.css?v=7.4` used across pages
- GA4 Measurement ID G-DMGBC1N1RX in <head> everywhere
- Our Videos page: Payhip Buy buttons (Mgw7n, jK30s) + updated copy/pricing
- Fallback YouTube helper (`/assets/fallback-youtube.js`) for optional click-to-play embeds
- robots.txt, sitemap.xml, and video-sitemap.xml updated

Post-upload checks
1) Visit /site.css?v=7.4 — verify it loads and shows v7.4 in the comment header.
2) Hard refresh / and /our-videos — embeds should play; Buy Now opens Payhip overlay.
